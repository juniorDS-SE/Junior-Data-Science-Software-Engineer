As you can see I've created .py (src folder) counterparts for some .ipynb (notebooks folder) files. The reason is simple. Less work and less time waste. I did use ipython and nbconvert packages to convert .ipynb files to .py files and then I could easily use data from all my notebooks through .py files simply by importing them. It save me a lot of time which I already did not have. To sum up -- it wasn't the best solution here but I was trying to get satysfying results while having day and a half (total) for this assignment.
