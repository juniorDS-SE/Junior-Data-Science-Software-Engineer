# Titanic - data science project 

Before jumping in to code please get to know with 3 .txt files:
    1 - docs/WhyNotebooks.txt
    2 - docs/WhyPy.txt
    3 - docs/WhyFunctionsPy.txt

Because of lack of time I could only complete TASK4, TASK5, TASK6 (half of it) 

### TASK1 - organizational instructions
 Create your own repository on Github or other public code versioning server. Use content of this project to create initial commit.
 
 Follow the rules:
* The solutions to all subsequnt tasks should be in your repository.
* Each task should be solved in separate branch using any number of commits. You can edit the code or add additional file explaining your way of thinking. The branch name should be related to the task, so we can know which branch applies to which task.
* All branches should finally be merged to master branch.
* At the end remember to share your repository with us.

### TASK2 - sense of humour
File with my favourite joke added to the docs directory.

### TASK3 - good practices
* Correct the code so it is easy to read, run and reuse.
* Remember about
  * README.md files
  * Code comments
  * quality and performance of code -- remove or fix badly written code

### TASK4 - feature engineering
I proposed better solution for feature engineering than the one given by you. You can find it in notebook directory.

### TASK5 - models


## Thanks for the opportunity!
